<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>This page is about all the assignments we have completed over the past year.
	Every assignmentwe have done has helped<br>us in a way to improve our coding skills.
	Every project was done each one with its own task teaching us the basics of code.<br><p/><br>
<h1>Lightbot</h1>
	<p>Lightbot is a basic coding game that helps beginning coders 
	understand basic coding.<br>The game inculde premade programs and gives you the blocks<br>nessesary to solve the problem.
	The blocks are very basic programs that move the robot
	up,down,left,right,and jumping.<br>This game is very fun and educational.</p>

<h1>Khan Academy</h1>
	<p>Khan Academy is a great learning tool that helps student in many areas<br>such 
	as math,science,history, and ect.Teachers can post assignment that student can 
	do for class.<br>Khan academy is a great tool for both student and teacherswhich makes things very easier.</p>

<h1>Scratch</h1>
	<p>Scratch is a website where you can find and edit games or create your ouw.<br> 
	The website has build in coding blocks the allow you tomake funtions for characters and background.<br>
	With the blocks you can do almost anything to create an awesome game you just need to know how to code it.</p>

<h1>App Iventor</h1>
	<p>App inventor was simular to scratch, but was a bit more advanced.<br>
	With this program we made our own app. It had the same idea as scrtach, but the coding blocks<br>
	were more advanced and specific on how its needs to be used. It was harder to get things to<br>
	work correctly. This was one of the best programs we used yet.</p>

<h1>Notepat++</h1>
	<p>Notepadd++ is a more advanced then the other assignments we had all year.With this prgram we 
	wrote our own code to lear how<br>to start to build a website. Working with notepad++ we learned
	basic coding tags to change back-ground<br>color, text size, text alignment, text color, ect.
	With all these assignments over the year we have learned alot about coding. <p/>

<h1>Git Hub</h1>
	<p>Git Hub is our most recent assignment. Git hub is the website we used to create web pages like this.<br>
	Git hub is the most advanced coding assignment we had. With this assignment we wrote our own code to<br>
	create a websit.</p>

<h1>Canopy</h1>
	<p>Canopy was the next coding tool we used after python. We used the knowledge we had from python to<br>
	create games. This coding tool allowed us to advance in coding and helped us develop our coding skills more.<br>
	We learned some new thing and used some of the same things. This tool was fun to work with because it helped us<br>
	better our skills. It was also fun creating the games to learn from our mistakes and improve it.<p/>

<h1>Guess Game</h1>
	<p>Guess game was the first game we created with python. The point of this assignment was to create a game that<br>
	generated a random number that the player had guess in a certain amount of tries. This assignment was fun to work with.<br>
	The biggest challenge with this assignment was getting to get the random number to generate correctly.<p/>

<h1>Lucky Sevens</h1>
	<p>Lucky Sevens was the next game we worked on in canopy. This game was a dice game.<br>
	We had to code two ramdon numer generators that stay within 1 and 7. The goal of the game<br>
	was to try to get as many sevens as you can until you run out of money.<p/>

<h1>Hang Man</h1>
	<p>Hang man was the last game we did. for this game we programmed a word bank and the <br>
	game chose one word to solve. If you guessed a correct etter it filled in the blank and if you got <br>
	a guess wrong it started to create the man hanging. You went until you solved the puzzle or lost. The<br>
	hardest part of this assignment was getting the body parts to generate correctly. Overall the game was<br>
	a fun and learning experience.<p/>
