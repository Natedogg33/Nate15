<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>This page is about all the assignments we have completed over the past year.
	Every assignmentwe have done has helped<br>us in a way to improve our coding skills.
	Every project was done each one with its own task teaching us the basics of code.<br><p/><br>
<h1>Lightbot</h1>
	<p>Lightbot is a basic coding game that helps beginning coders 
	understand basic coding.<br>The game inculde premade programs and gives you the blocks<br>nessesary to solve the problem.
	The blocks are very basic programs that move the robot
	up,down,left,right,and jumping.<br>This game is very fun and educational.</p>

<h1>App Iventor</h1>
	<p>App inventor was simular to scratch, but was a bit more advanced.<br>
	With this program we made our own app. It had the same idea as scrtach, but the coding blocks<br>
	were more advanced and specific on how its needs to be used. It was harder to get things to<br>
	work correctly. This was one of the best programs we used yet.</p>

<h1>Notepat++</h1>
	<p>Notepadd++ is a more advanced then the other assignments we had all year.With this prgram we 
	wrote our own code to lear how<br>to start to build a website. Working with notepad++ we learned
	basic coding tags to change back-ground<br>color, text size, text alignment, text color, ect.
	With all these assignments over the year we have learned alot about coding. <p/>
